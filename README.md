# Eclipse2015

These repository contains data and R code to analyse trends in solar radiation during the solar eclipse of March 20, 2015. Data was taken from the weather station at the roof of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena. 

Data from the weather station at Beutenberg campus is in the file `mpi_roof.csv` as comma delimited file. Code with analyses of the data are in the file `Eclipse2015.Rmd`, an R markdown file that can be run using `Knitr` to produce the file `Eclipse2015.pdf`.

Everyone is welcome to explore and download code and data. Feel free to add other analyses and datasets through a pull request. 

In case of questions contact Carlos A. Sierra (csierra@bgc-jena.mpg.de).
